# 3.52.0 (2023-01-17)

### Improvements

- [sdk] Add experimental support for writing custom resource providers. This is a preview release, code
  documentation and test coverage is known to be minimal, and all APIs are subject to change. However it is
  complete enough to try out, and we hope to get feedback on the interface to refine and stabilize this
  shortly.
