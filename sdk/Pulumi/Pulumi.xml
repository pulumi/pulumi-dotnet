             Danger: these utilities are intended for use in test and
             debugging scenarios. In normal Pulumi programs, please
             consider using `.Apply` instead to chain `Output{T}`
             transformations without unpacking the underlying T. Doing
             so preserves metadata such as resource dependencies that
             is used by Pulumi engine to operate correctly. Using
             `await output.GetValueAsync()` directly opens up a possibility

            CleanKey takes a configuration key, and if it is of the form "(string):config:(string)"
            removes the ":config:" portion. Previously, our keys always had the string ":config:" in
            them, and we'd like to remove it. However, the language host needs to continue to set it
            so we can be compatible with older versions of our packages. Once we stop supporting
            older packages, we can change the language host to not add this :config: thing and
            remove this function.

             <summary>
             The child resources of this resource.  We use these (only from a ComponentResource) to
             allow code to dependOn a ComponentResource and have that effectively mean that it is
             depending on all the CustomResource children of that component.
            
             Important!  We only walk through ComponentResources.They're the only resources that
             serve as an aggregation of other primitive(i.e.custom) resources.While a custom resource
             can be a parent of other resources, we don't want to ever depend on those child
             resource.  If we do, it's simple to end up in a situation where we end up depending on a
             child resource that has a data cycle dependency due to the data passed into it. An
             example of how this would be bad is:
            
             <c>
                 var c1 = new CustomResource("c1");
                 var c2 = new CustomResource("c2", { parentId = c1.id }, { parent = c1 });
                 var c3 = new CustomResource("c3", { parentId = c1.id }, { parent = c1 });
             </c>
            
             The problem here is that 'c2' has a data dependency on 'c1'.  If it tries to wait on
             'c1' it will walk to the children and wait on them.This will mean it will wait on 'c3'.
             But 'c3' will be waiting in the same manner on 'c2', and a cycle forms. This normally
             does not happen with ComponentResources as they do not have any data flowing into
             them.The only way you would be able to have a problem is if you had this sort of coding
             pattern:
            
             <c>
                 var c1 = new ComponentResource("c1");
                 var c2 = new CustomResource("c2", { parentId = c1.urn }, { parent: c1 });
                 var c3 = new CustomResource("c3", { parentId = c1.urn }, { parent: c1 });
             </c>
            
             However, this would be pretty nonsensical as there is zero need for a custom resource to
             ever need to reference the urn of a component resource.  So it's acceptable if that sort
             of pattern failed in practice.

             Here, we check whether the generic list is default(ImmutableArray[T])

             The use of reflection is unavoidable because we cannot _statically_ resolve the

             The `Status` type defines a logical error model that is suitable for different
             programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs. It is used by
             [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc). The error model is designed to be:
            
             - Simple to use and understand for most users
             - Flexible enough to meet unexpected needs
            
             # Overview
            
             The `Status` message contains three pieces of data: error code, error message,
             and error details. The error code should be an enum value of
             [google.rpc.Code][google.rpc.Code], but it may accept additional error codes if needed.  The
             error message should be a developer-facing English message that helps
             developers *understand* and *resolve* the error. If a localized user-facing
             error message is needed, put the localized message in the error details or
             localize it in the client. The optional error details may contain arbitrary
             information about the error. There is a predefined set of error detail types
             in the package `google.rpc` which can be used for common error conditions.
            
             # Language mapping
            
             The `Status` message is the logical representation of the error model, but it
             is not necessarily the actual wire format. When the `Status` message is
             exposed in different client libraries and different wire protocols, it can be
             mapped differently. For example, it will likely be mapped to some exceptions
             in Java, but more likely mapped to some error codes in C.
            
             # Other uses
            
             The error model and the `Status` message can be used in a variety of
             environments, either with or without APIs, to provide a
             consistent developer experience across different environments.
            
             Example uses of this error model include:
            
             - Partial errors. If a service needs to return partial errors to the client,
                 it may embed the `Status` in the normal response to indicate the partial
                 errors.
            
             - Workflow errors. A typical workflow has multiple steps. Each step may
                 have a `Status` message for error reporting purpose.
            
             - Batch operations. If a client uses batch request and batch response, the
                 `Status` message should be used directly inside batch response, one for
                 each error sub-response.
            
             - Asynchronous operations. If an API call embeds asynchronous operation
                 results in its response, the status of those operations should be
                 represented directly using the `Status` message.
            
             - Logging. If some API errors are stored in logs, the message `Status` could
                 be used directly after any stripping needed for security/privacy reasons.

            A version range to check against the engine (CLI) version. If the version is not compatible with the specified
            range, an error is returned. The supported syntax for ranges is that of
            https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/blang/semver#ParseRange. For example ">=3.0.0", or "!3.1.2". Ranges can be AND-ed
            together by concatenating with spaces ">=3.5.0 !3.7.7", meaning greater-or-equal to 3.5.0 and not exactly 3.7.7.
            Ranges can be OR-ed with the `||` operator: "&lt;3.4.0 || >3.8.0", meaning less-than 3.4.0 or greater-than 3.8.0.

            Engine is an auxiliary service offered to language and resource provider plugins. Its main purpose today is
            to serve as a common logging endpoint, but it also serves as a state storage mechanism for language hosts
            that can't store their own global state.

             PluginAttach is used to attach an already running plugin to the engine.
            
             Normally the engine starts the plugin process itself and passes the engine address as the first argumnent.
             But when debugging it can be useful to have an already running provider that the engine instead attaches
             to, this message is used so the provider can still be passed the engine address to communicate with.

             If this resource has been specified with the

             differ from those written in the Pulumi program registering this resource. In such cases, the caller (e.g. the
             Pulumi engine) is expected to preprocess the `news` value by replacing every property matched by `ignoreChanges`
             with its corresponding `olds` value (effectively ignoring the change).

             `DiffResponse` is the type of responses sent by a [](pulumirpc.ResourceProvider.DiffConfig) or
             [](pulumirpc.ResourceProvider.Diff) call. A `DiffResponse` indicates whether a resource is unchanged, requires
             updating (that is, can be changed "in place"), or requires replacement (that is, must be destroyed and recreated
             anew). Legacy implementations may also signal that it is unknown whether there are changes or not.
            
             `DiffResponse` has evolved since its inception and there are now a number of ways that providers can signal their
             intent to callers:
            
             * *Simple diffs* utilise the `changes` field to signal which fields are responsible for a change, and the `replaces`
               field to further communicate which changes (if any) require a replacement as opposed to an update.
            
             * *Detailed diffs* are those with `hasDetailedDiff` set, and utilise the `detailedDiff` field to provide a more
               granular view of the changes that have occurred. Detailed diffs are designed to allow providers to control
               precisely which field names are displayed as responsible for a change, and to signal more accurately what kind of
               change occurred (e.g. a field was added, deleted or updated).
            
             The response must satisfy the following invariants:
            
             * For each top-level key in `diff` there is at least one matching property path, starting at that key, in `detailedDiff`.
             * For each entry in `detailedDiff`, its top-level property is in `diff`.
             * `diff` does not contain duplicates.
             * `detailedDiff` does not contain duplicate keys.

            `detailedDiff` can be used to implement more detailed diffs. A detailed diff is a map from [property
            paths](property-paths) to [](pulumirpc.PropertyDiff)s, which describe the kind of change that occurred to the
            property located at that path. If a provider does not implement this, the caller (typically the Pulumi engine)
            will compute a representation based on the simple diff fields (`changes`, `replaces`, and so on).

            The ResourceProvider service defines a standard interface for [resource providers](providers). A resource provider
            manages a set of configuration, resources, functions and so on in a single package, and offers methods such as CRUD
            operations on resources and invocations of functions. Resource providers are primarily managed by the Pulumi engine
            as part of a deployment in order to interact with the cloud providers underpinning a Pulumi application.

            `Handshake` is the first call made by the engine to a provider. It is used to pass the engine's address to the
            provider so that it may establish its own connections back, and to establish protocol configuration that will be
            used to communicate between the two parties. Providers that support `Handshake` should return responses
            consistent with those returned in response to [](pulumirpc.ResourceProvider.Configure) calls where there is
            overlap due to the use of `Configure` prior to `Handshake`'s introduction.

             <summary>
             `Parameterize` is the primary means of supporting [parameterized providers](parameterized-providers), which allow
             a caller to change a provider's behavior ahead of its [configuration](pulumirpc.ResourceProvider.Configure) and
             subsequent use. Where a [](pulumirpc.ResourceProvider.Configure) call allows a caller to influence provider
             behaviour at a high level (e.g. by specifying the region in which an AWS provider should operate), a
             `Parameterize` call may change the set of resources and functions that a provider offers (that is, its schema).
             This is useful in any case where some "set" of providers can be captured by a single implementation that may
             power fundamentally different schemata -- dynamically bridging Terraform providers, or managing Kubernetes
             clusters with custom resource definitions, for instance, are good examples. The parameterized package that
             `Parameterize` yields is known as a *sub-package* of the original (unparameterized) package.
            
             `Parameterize` supports two types of parameterization:
            
             * *Replacement parameterization*, whereby a `Parameterize` call results in a schema that completely replaces the
               original provider schema. Bridging a Terraform provider dynamically might be an example of this -- following
               the call to `Parameterize`, the provider's schema will become that of the Terraform provider that was bridged.
               Providers that implement replacement parameterization expect a *single* call to `Parameterize`.
            
             * *Extension parameterization*, in which a `Parameterize` call results in a schema that is a superset of the
               original. This is useful in cases where a provider can be extended with additional resources or functions, such
               as a Kubernetes provider that can be extended with resources representing custom resource definitions.
               Providers that implement extension parameterization should accept multiple calls to `Parameterize`. Extension
               packages may even be called multiple times with the same package name, but with different versions. The CRUD
               operations of extension resources must include the version of which sub-package they correspond to.
            
             `Parameterize` should work the same whether it is provided with `ParametersArgs` or `ParametersValue` input. In
             each case it should return the sub-package name and version (which when a `ParametersValue` is supplied should
             match the given input).

             `CheckConfig` validates a set of configuration inputs that will be passed to this provider instance.
             `CheckConfig` is to provider resources what [](pulumirpc.ResourceProvider.Check) is to individual resources, and
             is the first stage in configuring (that is, eventually executing a [](pulumirpc.ResourceProvider.Configure) call)
             a provider using user-supplied values. In the case that provider inputs are coming from some source that has been
             checked previously (e.g. a Pulumi state), it is not necessary to call `CheckConfig`.
            
             A `CheckConfig` call returns either a set of checked, known-valid inputs that may subsequently be passed to
             [](pulumirpc.ResourceProvider.DiffConfig) and/or [](pulumirpc.ResourceProvider.Configure), or a set of errors
             explaining why the inputs are invalid. In the case that a set of inputs are successfully validated and returned,
             `CheckConfig` *may also populate default values* for provider configuration, returning them so that they may be
             passed to a subsequent [](pulumirpc.ResourceProvider.Configure) call and persisted in the Pulumi state. In the
             case that `CheckConfig` fails and returns a set of errors, it is expected that the caller (typically the Pulumi
             engine) will fail provider registration.
            
             As a rule, the provider inputs returned by a call to `CheckConfig` should preserve the original representation of
             the properties as present in the program inputs. Though this rule is not required for correctness, violations
             thereof can negatively impact the end-user experience, as the provider inputs are used for detecting and
             rendering diffs.

             `DiffConfig` compares an existing ("old") provider configuration with a new configuration and computes the
             difference (if any) between them. `DiffConfig` is to provider resources what [](pulumirpc.ResourceProvider.Diff)
             is to individual resources. `DiffConfig` should only be called with values that have at some point been validated
             by a [](pulumirpc.ResourceProvider.CheckConfig) call. The [](pulumirpc.DiffResponse) returned by a `DiffConfig`
             call is used primarily to determine whether or not the newly configured provider is capable of managing resources
             owned by the old provider. If `DiffConfig` indicates that the provider resource needs to be replaced, for
             instance, then all resources owned by that provider will *also* need to be replaced. Replacement semantics should
             thus be reserved for changes to configuration properties that are guaranteed to make old resources unmanageable.
             Changes to an AWS region, for example, will almost certainly require a provider replacement, but changes to an
             AWS access key, should almost certainly not.

             `Configure` is the final stage in configuring a provider instance. Callers may supply two sets of data:
            
             * Provider-specific configuration, which is the set of inputs that have been validated by a previous
               [](pulumirpc.ResourceProvider.CheckConfig) call.
             * Provider-agnostic ("protocol") configuration, such as whether or not the caller supports secrets.
            
             The provider is expected to return its own set of protocol configuration, indicating which features it supports
             in turn so that the caller and the provider can interact appropriately.
            
             Providers may expect a *single* call to `Configure`. If a call to `Configure` is missing required configuration,
             the provider may return a set of error details containing [](pulumirpc.ConfigureErrorMissingKeys) values to

             :::{important}
             The use of `Configure` to configure protocol features is deprecated in favour of the
             [](pulumirpc.ResourceProvider.Handshake) method, which should be implemented by newer providers. To enable
             compatibility between older engines and providers:
            
             * Callers which call `Handshake` *must* call `Configure` with flags such as `acceptSecrets` and `acceptResources`
               set to `true`, since these features predate the introduction of `Handshake` and thus `Handshake`-aware callers
               must support them. See [](pulumirpc.ConfigureRequest) for more information.
             * Providers which implement `Handshake` *must* support flags such as `acceptSecrets` and `acceptResources`, and
               indicate as such by always returning `true` for these fields in [](pulumirpc.ConfigureResponse). See
               [](pulumirpc.ConfigureResponse) for more information.

             as `terraform`, and a *source provider name*, which is the name of the provider *in the source language*. Given
             these, it returns source-specific mapping data for the provider requested. As an example, the Pulumi AWS
             provider, which is bridged from the Terraform AWS provider and thus capable of mapping names between the two,
             might respond to a call with key `terraform` and source provider name `aws` with mapping data for transforming
             (among other things) Terraform AWS names such as `aws_s3_bucket` into Pulumi AWS types such as
             `aws:s3/bucket:Bucket`. If a provider only supports a single source provider, or has some sensible default, it
             may respond also to a call in which the source provider name is empty (`""`), which will be made when the engine
             does not have sufficient knowledge to work out which provider offers a specific mapping.
            
             In general, it is expected that providers implemented by bridging an equivalent provider from another ecosystem
             (such as bridged Terraform providers built atop the `pulumi-terraform-bridge`, for instance) implement
             `GetMapping` to support conversion from that ecosystem into Pulumi using the same logic that underpins the
             bridging itself.

             `GetMappings` is an optional method designed to aid in [converting programs and state from other
             ecosystems](converters). `GetMappings` accepts a "conversion key". This corresponds to a source language, for
             which we want to retrieve mappings for names etc. from that source language into Pulumi. An example key might
             therefore be `terraform` in the event that we wish to map e.g. Terraform resource names to Pulumi resource types.
             Given a key, `GetMappings` returns a list of *source provider names* for which calls to `GetMapping` will return
             mappings. So, continuing the Terraform example, the Pulumi AWS provider, which is bridged from the Terraform AWS
             provider and thus capable of mapping names between the two, might return the list `["aws"]` in response to a call
             with key `terraform`.
            
             If a provider does not implement `GetMappings`, the engine will fall back to calling `GetMapping` blindly without
             a source provider name (that is, with the value `""`).

             `Configure` is the final stage in configuring a provider instance. Callers may supply two sets of data:
            
             * Provider-specific configuration, which is the set of inputs that have been validated by a previous
               [](pulumirpc.ResourceProvider.CheckConfig) call.
             * Provider-agnostic ("protocol") configuration, such as whether or not the caller supports secrets.
            
             The provider is expected to return its own set of protocol configuration, indicating which features it supports
             in turn so that the caller and the provider can interact appropriately.
            
             Providers may expect a *single* call to `Configure`. If a call to `Configure` is missing required configuration,
             the provider may return a set of error details containing [](pulumirpc.ConfigureErrorMissingKeys) values to
             indicate which keys are missing.

            creation error or an initialization error). Since Cancel is advisory and non-blocking, it is up
            to the host to decide how long to wait after Cancel is called before (e.g.)
            hard-closing any gRPC connection.

            If this is not set to true and the engine detects the request is from the

            correct ones.
            Other SDKs that are correctly specifying alias specs could set this to
            true, but it's not necessary.

            Mapper provides methods for retrieving mappings that describe how to map names in some source "provider" (e.g. a
            Terraform provider, if we are converting from Terraform) to names in appropriate Pulumi packages. So when converting
            a Terraform program containing code like `resource "aws_s3_bucket" "b" {}`, for instance, we need to know (among
            other things) that the `aws_s3_bucket` Terraform resource type corresponds to the Pulumi type `aws:s3/bucket:Bucket`,
            and thus lives in the `aws` package. This is the kind of information that a Mapper provides.
